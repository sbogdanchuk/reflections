Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: If I want to share my work with others and collaborate on project.
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: You do not nessesarily need to be uptodate at every moment of time, so you can do sync only on need.
